To approach this cybersecurity project at 4Geeks Academy, I would follow a methodical and structured approach to identify and resolve the issue with the malicious user. Here is a detailed step-by-step plan:

### 1. **Gather Initial Information**

- **Access to Logs and Audits**: I would start by requesting access to all audit records and system logs from the Ubuntu server. This includes access logs, permission change logs, and any other relevant logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog`, and specific application logs).

- **Review Current Permissions**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the current permissions for each user (Alejandro, Daniela, Vanessa, Chema, and the Analyst) over the different directories and files.

### 2. **Log Analysis and Activity Review**

- **Filter Suspicious Activities**: Analyze the logs for unusual activities, such as access attempts outside normal hours, multiple failed authentication attempts, and commands executed that could modify permissions or access sensitive data.

- **Activity Comparison**: Compare each user's behavior patterns with their roles and responsibilities. For example, Chema might have more access to security tools, while Daniela might focus more on platform development.

### 3. **Identify the Malicious User**

- **Identify Incorrect Permissions**: Review permissions on common directories and files to identify users with excessive or inappropriate permissions. This can be done using commands like `ls -l` and `getfacl`.

- **Log Correlation**: Correlate suspicious activities found in the logs with users who have inappropriate permissions. This can help identify the user attempting malicious activities.

### 4. **Analyze Intentions**

- **Review Executed Commands**: Analyze the commands executed by the suspicious user to understand their intentions. For example, if the user executed commands to copy sensitive data or modify configuration files.

- **Interviews and Confirmation**: Conduct interviews with the team to gather more context on recent activities and confirm if any user has reported access issues or unusual behavior.

### 5. **Inappropriate Permissions and Actions Executed**

- **Identified Permissions**: Document the specific permissions the malicious user had and on which directories. This includes read, write, and execute permissions.

- **Malicious Actions**: Describe the specific actions the user could perform due to those permissions. For example, accessing configuration directories, copying sensitive data, or modifying critical scripts.

### 6. **Resolving the Issue**

- **Revoke Permissions**: Immediately revoke the inappropriate permissions of the identified user. This can be done using commands like `chmod` and `chown` to modify file and directory permissions and ownership.

- **Update Security Policies**: Implement stricter access control and permission policies, ensuring each user only has the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up monitoring tools and alerts to detect suspicious activities in real-time. This could include using tools like `auditd` and `ossec`.

- **Team Training**: Provide additional training to the team on best security practices and the importance of following access and permission policies.

### Conclusion

With this methodical approach, we can identify the malicious user, analyze their movements, understand their intentions, and take corrective actions to ensure the system is secure and permissions are properly managed. This process also helps strengthen the team's security posture and prevent future incidents.
