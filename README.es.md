Each user has their own directories and files, as well as some shared ones, with different permissions on the shared files. One of these users has permissions they shouldn't have and seems to be up to something. Can you discover who it is?

1. Identify the malicious user
2. Analyze their actions and explain what they were attempting to do
3. Determine what permissions they had and on which directories that allowed them to execute this action
4. Propose a solution to this problem

> ⚠️ The Sticky bit permission (rwx-t) is often used to grant selective access to files and directories.
